# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is, well, let's be honest. Tweeter is here to give some strong competition to twitter. To friendly eye soothing simple web app for random Johns and Janes to post their thoughts (positive vibes strictly enforced!!!). Come on in, share your thoughts as well. Jokes aside, it a simple full stack application I built during my web-dev bootcamp journey at Lighthouse Labs, Toronto. With each session, user can write tweets (upto 140 characters). Input validations are in place. Every tweet gets added to local database with a timestamp and user can scroll through them in descending orders. Overall, it is a great project to learn and implement jQuery, AJAX calls , CSS and an overall working experience to 'near' real life developers. Some migth say that page layout/design is outdated, but personally I love such simplistic user experience with soothing colors and symmetry. Sharp edges can be found throughout all elements, showing consistency.

## This is how it looks.
